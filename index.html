    <p>“This is your last chance. After this, <br> there is no turning back. <br> You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your <br> bed and believe whatever you want to believe. <br> You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland, <br> and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, <br> all I'm offering is the truth – nothing more.”
